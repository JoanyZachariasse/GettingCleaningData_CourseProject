##Course project Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the script and documentation files for the course project of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The aim of the project was to prepare a tidy dataset, which is called "dataFinal2" here. 

The following files are present in the repository:
* README.md: this file
* CodeBook.md: the CodeBook of the project, explaining the source of the data, the new "dataFinal2" dataset, the required transformations to get from the original to the new data and the description of the variables in the dataset.
* run_analysis.R: the R script that contains the code for creating the "dataFinal2" dataset

To run the script, unzip the original data and save it in the working directory. The script can be run in R or R studio and requires the dplyr package to be installed. 
The resulting file "dataFinal2.txt" has been uploaded to the Coursera website or can be obtained by running the complete script including the read.table command at the end.
